 The efcgi application is an OTP application that supports the fast cgi
protocol. Currently the system expects to communicate with the fastcgi
server via tcp sockets only. It also expects to be started by the otp
release handling system, and configured after start by the application
making use of the system.


Starting and testing from the shell

> application:start(efcgi).
> efcgi:start(<Port Number>, <Module Name>).

This will start a fast cgi process on the specified port with the
specified module as the handler. The module must implement the
gen_efcgi behaviour or bad things happen.

If you are using fast cgi as part of an otp system the release handler
will start efcgi for you. All you need do is call efcgi:start/2 in
 your initialization routine.
