Why do we need use Erlang with FastCGI when we have YAWS? Isn't it
stable enough or maybe there are oher reasons that I know nothing
about?
    
    Yaws is pretty awesome. However, its still pretty new with a
    pretty small base of users, which makes some people uncomfortable
    with it. Also in many companies (including my own) http servers
    have to go through a rigorous vetting process before they can be
    exposed to users. Its far easier just to use the existing servers
    with fastcgi support then to try and get yaws approved (it just
    wouldn't be in all actuality. The security guys are real stick in
    the muds). Also, I already run lighttpd as my principle server,
    its much nicer just to sit dynamic behavior behind that then it is
    to manage and run another http server.
